# Pet Info
Saw a cool pet? Have no idea what it was or how to get it?
Now you can find out without having to even ask other players!

The Pet Info plugin for RuneLite allows you to right-click pets for info about them,
like how they are obtained, or who owns it.
It also allows you to highlight pets, and have their names displayed above their heads.

The plugin will attempt to fetch the most up-to-date pets from the GitHub's
main branch, and save a local fallback copy.

##### Plans
* I want to re-write the description text to be more consistent, as well as more understandable.

###### Special thanks to the devs of the Implings and Menu Entry Swapper plugins
